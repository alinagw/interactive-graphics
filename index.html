                <p class="card-text">I wanted to implement drawing apps in different "spaces," challenging myself to
                    interpret what "space" means. I was interested in the drawing apps challenge, but I wanted to take
                    it a step further. This ended up being more of a coding challenge for myself to create different,
                    complex, and unusual spaces for users to draw shapes (or on shapes). After we experimented with
                    simple 2D drawing apps in class, I tried to imagine what other drawing tools I could create in
                    Processing that afford modes of drawing not traditionally offered. So I ended up testing out drawing
                    in 3D space in two sketches, as well as a more simplistic, literal take on space for the third
                    sketch.</p>

                <p class="card-text">For this challenge, I wanted to experiment with color blending and discover all the
                    different ways to blend color using p5.js. I played around with lerpColor() and hue to create
                    different effects across my sketches. I wanted to make all of them interactive, allowing the user to
                    control how the colors are blended and/or how the blended colors are displayed. Some are simple and
                    some are very complicated to get the color blending just right for the perfect color experience.</p>

                    express the different states of bipolar disorder. I created sketches for depression, stability, and
                    mania. Since the person with bipolar disorder experiences these states, I wanted the person
                    interacting with this sketch to drive the experience of the motion. The idea is for the user to feel
                    the emotions as a result of the interactive motion experience.</p>
