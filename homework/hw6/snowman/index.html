  <h3>Challenge: Remake Classmate's Sketch</h3>
  <p>Looking through my classmates' sketches, I was really drawn to <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jacquilerner/sketches/pyaxBtRz">Jacqueline's aesthetic sketch</a> with the four stacked black 3D cubes rotating at different speeds on a red background. I liked the simplicity of the sketch, but it was still so visually striking. The stacked cubes immediately reminded me of... a snowman! I wanted to recreate her sketch as my own imagined snowman. In complete contrast to her distressing black and red color scheme, this happy little fella is a much friendlier image. I tried to capture the stacking and rotation components from her piece and recreate it in a more playful manner.</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Watch and enjoy!
    </li>
    <li>
      If you want to stop the snowman's rotation to see what it looks like from the front, press and hold the mouse button.
