  <h1>Aquarium</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Play with JavaScript Objects</h3>
  <p>This sketch engages with JavaScript objects in an array by creating a Fish class. Each fish has different properties that determine it's size, speed, appearance, and current location. The aquarium will randomly spawn new fish with randomly chosen features by adding a new Fish object to the fishes array. Now you can sit back and witness the magic of JS objects in a soothing aquarium.</p>
