  <h1>Depression</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Motion of Bipolar Disorder</h3>
  <p>For this challenge, I wanted to use different forms of motion and interaction to express the different states of bipolar disorder. I created sketches for depression, stability, and mania. Since the <i>person</i> with bipolar disorder experiences these states, I wanted the <i>person</i> interacting with this sketch to drive the experience of the motion. The idea is for the user to feel the emotions as a result of the interactive motion experience. The user needs to take their meds, but it isn't always easy.</p>
  
  <p>This sketch conveys the state of depression. The background is dark, the cursor is lost in the blackness, and the meds always seem just out of reach. The user's job is to navigate through the motion (or lack thereof) of depression.</p>
