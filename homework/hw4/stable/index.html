  <h3>Challenge: Motion of Bipolar Disorder</h3>
  <p>For this challenge, I wanted to use different forms of motion and interaction to express the different states of bipolar disorder. I created sketches for depression, stability, and mania. Since the <i>person</i> with bipolar disorder experiences these states, I wanted the <i>person</i> interacting with this sketch to drive the experience of the motion. The idea is for the user to feel the emotions as a result of the interactive motion experience. The user needs to take their meds, but it isn't always easy.</p>
  
  <p>This sketch conveys the state of stability. You aren't experiencing a depressive or manic episode, so taking your meds may feel easier. This is obviously a very simple following motion.</p>


  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Click the medicine bottle because taking your meds is always important.
    </li>
  </ul>
