  <h1>Color Blender</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Color Blending</h3>
  <p>For this challenge, I wanted to experiment with color blending and discover all the different ways to blend color using p5.js. I played around with lerpColor() and hue to create different effects across my sketches. For this sketch, I <i>literally</i> created a color blender! I felt this was a good place to start using lerpColor() to find the halfway point between two colors. Adding in the blender graphic and juice effects just made the experience a little more fun.</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Select two colors you want to blend together using the two color pickers. Press the reset button when done picking to update the blender colors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Press and hold the button on the blender to mix the two colors. The button will turn green when fully mixed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Press the reset button to reset the blender to the current color picker colors.
    </li>
  </ul>
