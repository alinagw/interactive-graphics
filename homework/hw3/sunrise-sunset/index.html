  <h3>Challenge: Color Blending</h3>
  <p>For this challenge, I wanted to experiment with color blending and discover all the different ways to blend color using p5.js. I played around with lerpColor() and hue to create different effects across my sketches. This sketch was hard... definitely a huge challenge in getting the color blending just right at different points depending on the sun's location. I created 5 different sky gradients for different times of day, and had each correspond to a mouseY position of the sun with a power function to determine the transition points. I used lerpColor() to create the individual gradients, and <i>then</i> I lerped the colors between the two gradients the sun was "in-between" depending on how close the sun was to either gradient. The whole thing used lerpColor() 3 times. Hopefully you agree that it creates a beautiful interactive color experience.</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Move the mouse up and down on the canvas to move the sun and transition between the skies. Moving slowly shows more of the blending effects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hold down the space bar if you want to see the height fractions (where the gradients switch).
    </li>
  </ul>
