      <h1>Rainbow Scratch Art</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Color Blending</h3>
  <p>For this challenge, I wanted to experiment with color blending and discover all the different ways to blend color using p5.js. I played around with lerpColor() and hue to create different effects across my sketches. After pursuing more complicated color blending sketches, I took this one back to the drawing board (pun intended). I created a simple rainbow blended using the HSB color mode and changing the hue across the canvas. I added a black layer on top that you can "erase" revealing the rainbow underneath. Sound familliar? The whole point was to take you back to the good old days of rainbow scratch art!</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Press and drag the mouse to erase the black and draw.
