  <h1>Create Constellations</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Draw in Different Spaces</h3>
  <p>I wanted to implement different drawing apps in different "spaces," challenging myself to interpret what "space"
    means. In this sketch, you can draw in <i>actual</i> space! The stars in the night sky are generated randomly on
    each refresh. You can connect the dots to create constellations out of the star patterns. Each time you play will be
    different.</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Draw a line between two stars by clicking with your mouse on the first star and clicking the second star you
      want to connect it to</li>
    <li>To cancel drawing a line, click on empty space</li>
  </ul>
