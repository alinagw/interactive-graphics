  <h1>Draw in 3D</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Draw in Different Spaces</h3>
  <p>I wanted to implement different drawing apps in different "spaces," challenging myself to interpret what "space"
    means. In this sketch, I created a drawing app in 3D space. You can draw strokes with your mouse that exist in a 3D
    world that can be rotated. That way, you can draw on several planes to construct a 3D object viewable from (almost)
    every angle.</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Draw by clicking and dragging with your mouse on the canvas</li>
    <li>Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate your drawing around the y-axis in 3D space</li>
    <li>Use number keys 0 - 9 to change the brush color</li>
  </ul>
