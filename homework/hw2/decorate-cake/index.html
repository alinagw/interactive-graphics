  <h1>Decorate Your Own Birthday Cake</h1>

  <h3>Challenge: Draw in Different Spaces</h3>
  <p>I wanted to implement different drawing apps in different "spaces," challenging myself to interpret what "space"
    means. In this sketch, instead of drawing <i>in</i> 3D space, you are drawing on a 3D object in space. I wanted to
    make it a fun experience, so I transformed a simple box into a birthday cake. You can decorate the sides and the top
    however you want, but unfortunately it isn't actually edible...</p>

  <h4>Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Draw by clicking and dragging with your mouse on the canvas</li>
    <li>Select which part of the cake to draw on using the drop down, choose either "side" or "top"</li>
    <li>Change the color of your brush using the drop down</li>
  </ul>
